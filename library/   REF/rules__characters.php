				<em>Les Instructions pour la creation d&#39;un caract&egrave;re pour le jeu de <!--?php echo $siteName; ?-->:</em></p>
			
			<p>
				This section will give you full instruction regarding the processes and features of the character creation process, whilst it is quite a lengthy and in-depth process that needs to be carefully dealt with, we ask that you spend the utmost time during these processes to make sure that the characters you are creating are fully implementable and that their biographic pages are detailed as much for yourself as for other players and members of the Storytelling team who will use them to create stories for and around your characters.</p>
 
			<p>
				Players are allowed up to five (5) characters. Your first character must be a Featured Character (FC). Once you meet your 30 day waiting period, you may apply for an additional character. This may be either FC or an Original Creation (OC). For each OC you have, you MUST have an FC. We allow up to 5 characters per player, so this means you may have 3 FC&#39;s and 2 OC&#39;s, provided you are making proper posting requirements with each.</p>
 
			<hr >
			<h3>
				<font color="a5b9d5">A MONTH TRIAL PERIOD</font></h3>
			<p>
				Once you are approved for your first FC, you have a 30 physical day wait before you are able to bring another character into play. This is to ensure that you are able to make the minimum posting requirement. .Minimum posting is three (3) posts in a seven (7) day rotating period, and each post must be 200 words at the least. We also ask that you proof your posts before posting them on the game board!</p>

					<!-- BEGIN GETTING STARTED --> 
					<section id="getting_started"> 
 
					 <p>
						Firstly, we ask that you look at some of the character files on display in the interactive <a href="/cerebra.php">Cerebra&nbsp;Database</a>, in which you will find the biography pages for all of the current in-play characters, as well as for all of the pre-existing available canon-characters. We ask that you have a good look through these characters in order to choose the character that you want. Alternatively, if it is an original character that you wish to play on <!--?php echo $siteName; ?-->, we ask that you contact one of the moderators with the basic details of said character, so that we make sure that it is right for play on <!--?php echo $siteName; ?-->.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<b>NOTE:</b> ALL OCs must be adaptable to the <!--?php echo $siteName; ?-->movie-verse history and are not to be related to any FCs. This means you need to think about where your original character was and how they may have been involved during the events of X1, X2 and X3. We no longer require OC&#39;s to be original to <!--?php echo $siteName; ?-->only, you may now apply an OC from another game, provided they fit into our history.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						Once you&quot;ve requested a character, and said character has been approved for application on <!--?php echo $siteName; ?-->, it will be assigned to you by a moderator. If the assigned character exists in <!--?php echo $siteName; ?-->&quot;s comprehensive databases, it will be present almost immediately for player review on your <a href="/home.php">personalized home-page</a>, of which there will also be a button that reads &quot;edit.&quot; This button will take you to your character&quot;s bio form, which will be the main basis of character approval and is essential for <!--?php echo $siteName; ?-->to run smoothly and effectively. If the character doesn&#39;t exist, then please contact one of the site mentors (moderators) to discuss the character you wish to create and if it&#39;s the right character for <!--?php echo $siteName; ?-->. If it is, the Site Mentor will create a shell (character) for you to edit and submit.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						The first, and one of the most important things for character approval is the &#39;roleplay sample.&#39; It is vital that the moderation has an idea of the style and quality of your writing. This paragraph needs to be written in the third person as your pending character, and can be of any setting or situation. This sample needs to be at least 500 words.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						As far as the general and basic physical info, this will mainly be done for canon characters, but will need to be carefully completed for OCs. A made-up character needs a model with appropriate pictures uploaded on the form. Waivers refer to what you don&#39;t want your character to experience, such asphysical damage and sexual reference. Physical appearance is essential as well as images. We do not allow explicit or pornographic type pictures to be used. Xavier&#39;s is basically a school, so please used *yearbook appropriate* photos.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						Similarly with institute info, canon characters may already have this section filled in, however, made up characters will need to fill their own boxes, but these boxes are only suggestions and are liable to immediate change by the moderation regarding aspects such as traning squadrons.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						Please refer to the classifications and skills pages for further info on how to fill in the skills and select a muutant classification, these are especially important as they are sometimes used to decide who wins in battle situations, we ask that you make the levels realistic and don&#39;t try and make your character a &quot;god.&quot; Characters that are TOO powerful are likely to be rejected from <!--?php echo $siteName; ?-->. Original Character&quot;s character stats and power ranks are not allowed to exceed the Incredible mark. Nor are they allowed to have a classification beyond that of Epsilon. <!--?php echo $siteName; ?-->is not looking for perfect characters but for characters which are perfectly flawed and thus both fun to write and to write with.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						The next area is the area in which you will map out all of your characters skills, powers and weaknesses for use on the bio form, all of these features will be displayed on your character&quot;s form for one and all to see and refer to. Therefore it is crucial that you take your time with these pages and make sure that they are done correctly, if they are not used correctly, your bio will not be approved. We ask that students limit thair skills/advantages/disadvantages to 5 each please.
					 </p>
					 
					 <p>
						On these pages are various skills or powers or disadvantages that your character may/may not hold. These features should be carefully selected and completely relevant to your character, I would advise that you carefully think about what you want your character to have BEFORE looking in detail at these pages. DO NOT just pick things at random because you think they might be &quot;cool.&quot;</p>
					 
					 <p>
						Once you have chosen your preferred features, one is advised to copy/paste the short paragraph into your bio form, make sure that the skill name is in <em>CAPITAL LETTERS</em>, and the description is in lower case as this will make it easier to read and more presentable to others. Only NPC characters are permitted to use the generic paragraphs that are already written, this means that players of all made-ups and most canon characters will need to <strong>personalize</strong> the paragraphs to fit your character, this means a short explanation of how the character acquired the skill, or how he/she has used it tin the past.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<em>EXAMPLE:</em><br >
						<strong>ASTRONOMY</strong> - The science of the stars. <em>X</em> can use this skill to plot a course through the solar system.</p>
					 
					 
					 <p>
						A player who wishes to have this skill will need to add a few sentences which go above and beyond the description of the skill itself and explain how <em>character X</em> learned the skill in question.</p>
					 
					 
					 <p>
						<em>EXAMPLE:</em><br >
						Character 'X' acquired this knowledge during a four-year degree course at harvard university. X has recently been working in connection with NASA on projects regarding a cluster of stars high in the Earth&quot;s atmosphere.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						One thing to be careful of is that a skill/power must be something that your character is fully proficient in.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<em>EXAMPLE:</em><br >
						Both Lana and Chloe in the TV series SMALLVILLE, have picked someone&#39;s pocket at least once, so to has yours truly, as well as the likes of Lana and Chloe. I am not a pick pocket nor are they. Like them I picked the pocket of someone who wasn&#39;t the &#39;with it&#39;/sort of obtuse who wasn&#39;t expecting me to do it and i did it as a joke. SO if i was writing myself up, or Lana or Chloe from Smallville, none of us would get the &quot;pick pocket&quot; skill. This skill would go to someone who has done it many times or made a living out of it.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						We also ask that you try and originalize your character, we don&#39;t want a billion Wolverine-esque characters with minor differences, be creative and don&#39;t just mix powers from other characters.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						Moving on to the contacts, these are relatively simple and can be answered in points as opposed to paragraphs. Made-up enemies will need a short expanation of who they are and their reasons for dispute.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						Equipment uses the same theses as the skills sections, costume needs to be filled out manually in some detail, and we ask that you take into account the standard design used in the movies. Something similar to *standard student training uniform with ******* colored piping works well. You can often pick your own color.for the piping.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						The history sections are extremely important, particularly for made-up characters but also for canon players who wish to make slight changes to the character, we ask for at least 500 words with detailed explanations of their reasons for joining the mansion and life before x-men. ALL students MUST have been at Xavier&#39;s Institute for a minimum 0f six months. Please include this into your history. If you need assistance in finding out what has happened in game in that 6 month time frame, please contact a Mod.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						Once your bio has been completed, please select &quot;finished&quot; from the drop-down box and await contact from moderator, which will usually occur within two-to-four days and is the main reason why an IM address is essential.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						Moderator query and discussion will appear in the guidance and approvals boxes on the very top of the application form. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please use these tips to good use, one is again advised to not go overboard with the powers or ratings, and are reminded that there are limits to character ability, and it is at a moderator&#39;s descretion whether a character is TOO POWERFUL.</p>
					 
					 <hr >
					 <h3>
						BIO RECALL POLICY</h3>
					 <p>
						Our bio moderators, like everyone else, are flawed people and sometimes when they work they miss things. On the other hand, sometimes what&#39;s envisioned in a bio form sounds all well and good on paper but in play it doesn&#39;t quite add up. For that we have <strong>BIO RECALL.</strong></p>
					 
					 <p>
						BIO RECALL is when a character is in play and any moderator finds fault in a bio, a bio can be put on hold while a player does the requested changes. The aspects of the bio in conflict are to not be referenced during your posts.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						The bio in question will be given seven (7) days to rectify the issue and if not corrected it will be pulled fully and the character will be written out of the thread by the ST team.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						The BIO RECALL function can also work for you. If you have an aspect you want/need to change within your own bio - please email a Mentor to alert them to the change you wish to make to make sure they feel it&#39;s acceptable. They&#39;ll either give it a green light and give you seven (7) days to correct it or they&#39;ll deny it and you&#39;ll need to continue on as is.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						We understand the frustration in this situation but it is another one of our new policies to help make this game the best RPG we can make it. We appreciate your assistance in this.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						For any further questions please contact us. Thank you.</p>

						<h3>
							List of Advantages:</h3>
						<hr>
						<br >
						<p>
							<font color="#9ba9c5"><strong>360&ordm; PERCEPTION</strong> - </font> This gift allows the owner to &quot;see with the heart&quot;, allowing <strong>X</strong> to avoid overreliance with X eyes for seeing X environment. Telepathy to sense people in the area, or empathy to sense the emotions of those hiding could be an example. Having very good hearing, or a &quot;sixth sense&quot; could work as well.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>AMBIDEXTROUS</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> is equally capable of performing any task with either hand from writing to rolling dice and acts of slight of hand if they are so skilled. This means that <strong>X</strong> will be able to perform tasks just as well with one hand injured.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>APPROACHABLE</strong> - </span>There&#39;s something very approachable and non-threatening about <strong>X</strong> . Meaning that it is often <strong>X</strong> that people come to with their problems or questions.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>ATHLETE</strong> - </span>Naturally athletic, <strong>X</strong> has won multiple awards for athletic achievement. Much of this is due to training, but natural ability and aptitude also plays a lot in to it. This athletic ability can be in any sport or athletic event. This person may not even have an athletic background, but be naturally better at performance than the average person.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>ATTRACTIVE</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> has a habit of turning heads where ever they go, regardless of how they appear, they&#39;re just damn attractive. The more attractive you are, the more likely you are to be noticed, the same with the uglier you are. The more or less attractive they are, the harder it is to sneak through a crowd. A good appearance is also more likely to add to your approachability. Most mutants, other than those with physical mutations, fall under this. Their genetic superiority generally leaves them aestheticly pleasing to the eyes.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>BALANCE</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> can run across ropes or rails, stand on top of posts, effortlessly climb ropes and can easily recover from being thrown. Movement for <strong>X</strong> is unhindered while doing these things. <strong>X</strong> can also balance with their eyes closed.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>BLOODLINE</strong> - </span>A blood line is a line of people whom carry the same name, or ability. This goes for characters such as Donna Troy who was Wonder Woman&#39;s twin sister and took the name Wonder Girl. Villains are able to do something similar. More commonly referred to as &quot;Legacy Characters&quot;. Emma Frost comes from a rich family with a well spoken name, as well as Psylocke. Psylocke&#39;s brother is also a superhero in England.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>CAT NAP</strong> - </span>You need your usual amount of sleep, just not all at once. <strong>X</strong> can sleep at various short intervals and can get to sleep easier than others can.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>CAT STALK</strong> - </span>Moving at 1/4 of <strong>X</strong> maximum Movement rate, he/she can get to the planned destination almost invisibly. If someone wasn&#39;t watching <strong>X</strong> when they began, <strong>X</strong> is likely to get where they are going without being seen or heard. If <strong>X</strong> &#39;s target was watching them the entire time, <strong>X</strong> can&#39;t surprise the target or sneak past them.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>CHARISMATIC</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> just seems to have that special magnetic charm or appeal about them. There is something about <strong>X</strong> that people just can&#39;t seem to resist. X seems to have a personal attractiveness or interestingness that enables you to influence others in a positive manner. Positive in your eyes at least.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>CHIURGERY</strong> - </span>Mentally taxing to use, <strong>X</strong> can use acupuncture and massage-like techniques to concentrate the &quot;life&quot; energy in the subject&#39;s nerves and then cause them to send whatever impurities throughout the targets&#39; body, immediately healing Lethal damage (which ordinary first aid could not). It is not easy to work on someone else&#39;s nerves, though <strong>X</strong> can do so when the time is needed with much patience and practice.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>COMBAT REFLEXES</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> can react to threats almost instantly, meaning that he/she is very difficult to surprise and is extremely effective in close-range hand-to-hand combat</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>CON-GOER</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> is completely jazzed about the hobby/power possessed and what it can possibly amount to. <strong>X</strong> can push themselves to their limits as they try to go to new heights in the power, or sustain using it for prolonged periods of time. You would need this in order to push yourself past your current power level. Otherwise you can only push past it when you&#39;ve developed more skill in your ability and edited your profile to recognize your new potential.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>CONFIDENCE</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> possess an untouchable air of superiority that makes others instinctively realize they&#39;re not worried. They don&#39;t come off cocky, though they can at times. They just have a comforting presence that makes people know that <strong>X</strong> is the type of person who will get what they want when they want, by their own hands or use of powers if needed.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>CONVICTION</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> possesses great belief in them self, what <strong>X</strong> is doing, what he/she stands for. He/she is able to stand up to the forces of evil and temptation better than most.</p>

Meaning that <strong>X</strong> often gets into all sorts of trouble when something negative occurs unnecessarily, however is more often than not praised for <strong>X</strong> finding something critical.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>CUTE</strong> - </span>There&#39;s no getting around it: <strong>X</strong> is cute. <strong>X</strong> just has that kind of face and combined with <strong>X</strong> &#39;s self-effacing attitude and X tendency to put on an upbeat and sometimes ingenuous face, well... even acquiring a certain amount of scruffiness couldn&#39;t change the fact that <strong>X</strong> &#39;s ridiculously cute. And while <strong>X</strong> may one day grow into a handsome, sexy, even striking young wo/man one day, right now <strong>X</strong> &#39;s - *cute.* Whether <strong>X</strong> likes it or not.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>DAMN HEALTHY!</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> is, as the name implies, damn healthy. Meaning that he/she eats all the right foods and partakes in plenty of exercise to keep <strong>X</strong> &#39;s self in tiptop shape.</p>

							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>EMPATHY</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> can tell what someone is feeling.

							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>HIBERNATION</strong> - </span>When in extremely cold or otherwise hostile environments, <strong>X</strong> &#39;s body automatically lapses in to a complete state of metabolic hibernation. <strong>X</strong> &#39;s heart rate begins to slow, body temperature drops and all non-necessary bodily functions shut down while he/she is in hibernation. During this time <strong>X</strong> &#39;s need for food, water and to a degree, even air ceases as he/she begins to slowly absorb the necessary nutrients from <strong>X</strong> &#39;s body.

						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>INTERNAL COMPASS</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> is never lost or disoriented in any area that he/she has been to before.

							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>IRON MIND</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> &#39;s character is resistant to all forms of Telepathy and some Supernatural Senses as well as spells and powers that seek to read or control his thoughts.

							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>POKER FACE</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> is totally unflappable when it comes to keeping a straight face or holding on to information. No - one knows what he/she is thinking or how <strong>X</strong> is feeling. In some cases, <strong>X</strong> can also evade lie detectors and keep <strong>X</strong> &#39;X body in sync even when nervous</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>PRESENCE</strong> - </span>When <strong>X</strong> is present, EVERYONE knows it. <strong>X</strong> has such a charisma that he/she is able to steer events in any direction and make people feel any emotion. Especially useful if CHARACTER&#39;s are actors/performers.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>PSYCHIC VISION</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> can see &#39;limited&#39; glimpses of the future in visions or dreams. Interpreting the visions may be very difficult as the visions are often cloaked in an allegory and metaphor.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>QUICK LEARNER</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> can learn the basics of a new skill very quickly, such skills can range from academics such as theories or psychology, to manual such a mechanics or therapy skills, or even supernatural such as witchcraft or Wizardry. In some cases the learning of these skills can take minutes, hours or even learn entire fields in matters of weeks.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>RICH FRIENDS</strong> - </span>Be they friends of the family, school friends or even past-enemies, <strong>X</strong> has acquaintances who in turn have access or ownership of capital. This capital can be held in cash, business or property. <strong>X</strong> has a good enough bond qith such people that he can use this money to X advantage.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>SECOND SIGHT</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> can see energies and traces of super powers. He/She can tell if someone is charging their lazer (getting ready to cast a spell or use a supernatural gift). You can see if an item is magical. This also allows <strong>X</strong> to be able to tell if a person is a human/mutant/vampire/alien just by looking at them. However, there are limits to this advantage, the most notable being the inability to detect an unmaterialised ghost.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>SHAPE SHIFTING AWARENESS</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> has a natural affinity for detecting others like him/herself, even when the one being observed has changed to look like something else. When first encountering someone, X mind naturally &#39;pings&#39; whomever to confirm that the shape they are wearing is indeed their own.</p>
					 
						<hr>
						<p>
							<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>TIRELESS</strong> - </span> <strong>X</strong> can function better with less sleep then most. While the average person needs a good eight hours a night, <strong>X</strong> requires fewer hours or less than an hour of sleep per night in some cases. However, <strong>X</strong> still gets tired like a normal person/mutant, but this also happens at a slower pace.</p>

							&quot;Human&quot; or &quot;Homo-Sapien&quot; refers to a terrain who fits and coincides within the dominant society. And holds the same physicality and relative mentality as most of the living population. However, within these humans there are different levels that can be deduced using areas like height, strength or intelligence, to differentiate between humanity as a whole.<br >
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite to this refers to &quot;homo-superium&quot;. Nicknamed &quot;mutants&quot; based on the nature of these differences being biologically referred to as &quot;mutations.&quot; These, whilst predominantly still human, have certain attributes that differ greatly from mutants.<br >
							<em>Check the tables below:</em></p>

						<h3>
							TYPES OF MUTATION</h3>
						<p>
							<em><span style="color:#5bb3ff;">INDUCED </span></em>A mutation that is achieved through an action or event, be that event purpose or otherwise. For example, some sorts of radiation that come into contact with humans may cause involuntary mutations, of which this radiation can be passed through inhalation, touch, or even be passed into the bloodstream as food.<br >
							I.E. <em>Spiderman, Inhumnas or the Fantastic Four</em></p>
					 
						<p>
							<em><span style="color:#5bb3ff;">RANDON </span></em>The most common form of mutation, is a person who is a member of a gentec offshoot humanity, often described as a subspecies called Homo sapien superior (sometimes inaccurately referred to as a separate species). All mutants have a genetic mutation called an X-gene that causes their bodies to develop abilities that regular humans cannot. The majority of mutants develop these abilities, which vary from person to person, upon puberty, though there are some mutants who display powers and/or physical mutations from birth. Some mutants even display abilities from within the womb and posthumously, like Professor Charles Xavier and Jean Grey, respectively.<br >
							I.E. <em>Wolverine, Toad, Forge</em></p>
					 
						<p>
							<em><span style="color:#5bb3ff;">HEREDITARY </span></em>A mutation endowed upon a person by their birth, in that one or both of their parents, or in some cases grandparents were mutants, and the x-gene has been passed through generations and has been activated within a certain person. IN some cases, the abilities of these mutants may be similar to those held by the parents in question.<br >
							I.E. <em>Asgardian, Legion, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch &amp; Speed</em></p>
					 
						<p>
							<em><span style="color:#5bb3ff;">LATENT </span></em>One who possesses a mutant gene which while it will never become active in them, they can pass on there offspring. I.E. <em>Sarah Grey, Moira MacTaggart</em></p>

						<p>
							These mutants usually have the weakest form of mutation, in that the mutation&#39;s power(s) is generally solely based on physicality and/or appearance, such as various birth defections, which can often mean that a child is dead on birth. In some cases, the mutations in question can mean that some of sort of vaguely useful ability is held, but this is usually accompanied by some or many defects or disadvantages, such as mental inability or physical disability, or even in some cases a social deminuitives; such as not being able to interact with others well, this could be personality based or purely based on the mutation.<br >
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mutants uphold a bodily appearance that can be desribed as &#39;...indescribable.&#39; Something of which most humans would have never seen before, usually riddled with birth defects and missing limbs, or extra limbs, or mishaped limbs, or unknown limbs, or limbs in the wrong place. Usually this appearance will cause many disadvantages to the holder, both in the aspects of acquaintance, as well as sometimes causing internal defect.<br >
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mutant in question knows nothing about X ability, nor its capabilities. The power(s) may cause many disadvantages, and in some cases, may cause feinting or comaisation when they are used. The mutant has no control regarding when the powers are in use or not.</p>

						Equipment is considered to be anything your character routinely carries on them. As such equipment lists should be reasonable, based on wieght and the volume of what YOUR character can reasonably carry on them. Below you will find an initial offering of sanctioned pieces of Equipment for your character to make use of. Please select those, if any which are approperiate for your character and copy them from this directory and paste them in to the &#39;Equipment&#39; field of your character application. When pasting the descriptions, please take a moment to proof read the pronoun descriptions and make sure that they properly reflect your characters gender and identity.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><em> Note:</em>  Some items are considered to be rare, or have other extenuating circumstances which cause them to require specific &#39;mod&#39; approval to possess.</span></p>

					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">AEROSOL SPRAYS:</span> <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> has access to a number of chemical-delivery devices, each of which comes in small cylindrical canisters. They can fill a 20-square foot area or target a single foe. They include rapid room-filling fogger, an infrared paint marker, a foaming explosive comparable to plastic explosives such as plastique, an electronic device freezer, and quick-acting knockout gas. <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> can prepare other sprays and compounds if he has the time to acquire the necessary material.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">BOOMERANGS:</span> <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> utilizes a thrown spinning weapon based on one of Australian&#39;s unique aboriginal hunting tools - the boomerang.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">BINOCULARS:</span> The <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> has a digitally enhanced set of binoculars that can attach with electrostatic clips to the front of his mask over his eyes. The lenses provide magnification up to 60x, infrared vision, and limited ultraviolet imaging with nightvision light amplification and bloom suppression to reduce glare and flash blinding. There&#39;s a limited computer link with infrared and frame-capture that can transmit to the Batcomputer or other devices.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">CAPSULES - Various effect(s):</span> <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> has a number of small capsules that contain a variety of chemicals or gases and are primarily used to distract or disable multiple opponents. Six of these capsules in any combination can be fitted into a single utility belt pouch. They each contain enough gas to fill a 100-square-foot area; they include knockout gas capsules, regurgitive capsules, smoke capsules, and tear gas capsules.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">COMPUTER - Handheld:</span> This is a miniaturized collapsible laptop computer used by <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> in the field. It has the latest and greatest in modern computer hardware packed into its collapsible frame, and is able to create and work with a wide variety of media-storage. It can be used as a remote control console for the Batmobile and other vehicles, and has a global positioning system and encrypted wireless uplink to the Batcomputer. The software is primarily focused on aiding investigation and research tasks.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">CUFFS:</span> It helps to have cuffs like the cops do, and though he used to have the old bat-cuffs like Batman would carry, Nightwing uses his own version which, again, are in the &#39;bird thing&#39; style. They&#39;re roughly as tough as police issue, but without the flexible little chain links in the middle. These are more or less a solid affair that allow minimum movement and keep the hands not only from coming apart, but from getting close enough together to palm anything back and forth.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">DE-CEL JUMPLINE/LAUNCHER:</span> Though he has launchers integrated into his gauntlets, <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> also sometimes carries the standard wall-penetrating grapnel with del-cel jumpline. It comes standard with two hundred feet of line, a diamond-tipped piton that will penetrate most types of masonry with a solid hold, and will hold up to four hundred pounds without fatigue and about twice that much without snapping right away, though that much weight will strain the line and eventually cause it to give. The recoil device is enough to haul up about twice <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> &#39;s weight without much trouble, and the firing canister has enough CO2 for ten shots before needing to be replaced.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">EXPLOSIVES:</span> While the <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> abstains from the use of lethal force, the <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> has found it useful to have explosives on hand to sabotage enemy plans and to bypass or escape obstacles. There&#39;s three primary types he uses; a small &quot;pellet&quot; grenade with five second delay and quick-setting contact cement, a concussion/blast grenade that can be set for explosive charge or flash/bang charge and uses radio command or time delay, and a bungee-prima cord that is used to trigger several other charges in a line.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">FLASHLIGHT:</span> This is little more than a small, bright LED flashlight that has a convenient strap to fit on <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span>&#39;s finger. It has filters to make the light red (to preserve his natural night vision) and blue (to...shine blue light instead of white or red...).</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">FORENSICS/CRIME SCENE KIT:</span> <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> is a detective, and like any good detective, he has a kit for collecting and analyzing evidence from a crime scene. This portable forensics kit has labeled sample bags, fingerprinting gear, gas chromatograph, and a detachable video camera. It provides its user with enough evidence analysis equipment to do an initial review of a clue or a whole crime scene, though detailed analysis may require time at one of the Batcave&#39;s forensics labs and the Batcomputer.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">FLIGHT-BELT:</span> <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> utilizes a &#39;space-aged&#39; carrying system which allows the wearer to actually fly through no apparent means, simulating the power of telekinetic assisted Flight<br >
						RANK: (RANGE/DURATION) <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">Note: Rank determines both range and duration. Mod approval is required.</span></p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">GAS MASK:</span> When expecting exposure to toxic and biohazardous gases, <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> utilizes a large one-man gas mask. It protects against all nerve gases, as well as nuclear, biological, and chemical toxins. A more compact model of the gas mask can also be used for slightly less protection. These can be fitted in six-pack magazines with are found in all utility belts.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">GAS PELLETS:</span> In appearance they&#39;re little more than spheres the size of ping-pong balls, but when thrown they start to spew gas everywhere. Exactly what they spew is up to whatever Nightwing decides to put in them. It could be tear gas, knockout gas, or regurgitant, or even just a smokescreen. Those things are useful. It could potentially also be something real nasty like nerve gas, but he wouldn&#39;t put that in a gas pellet. Would he?</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">GRAPEL LAUNCHER:</span> This wall-penetrating grapnel launcher contains four piercing darts, each equipped with a tiny diamond drill head, directional fine, and 200 feet of a thermoplastic multi filament yarn spun from liquid crystal polymers. The darts can attach to numerous building materials, and the grapnel has a mechanism for reeling, braking, and clipping the line.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">GRAPPELING HOOK:</span> This hook launcher can fire 200 feet of tightly wound de-cel monofilament jumpline, and can support up to 400 pounds without bending. It can support up to 800 pounds for a short time if needed. The launcher&#39;s internal CO2 cartridge is good for 10 firings, and these can be replaced with filled cartridges by swapping them out via the launcher handle.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">HANDCUFFS:</span> These restraint devices are based on police-issue Ty-Cuffs, made of a sapphire-laced nylon with a stranded metal cable center. The only way to remove them is with either superhuman strength or a special diamond-edged cutting tool, the latter of which <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> typically carries in his utility belt.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">MINI - CEREBRA:</span> Developed by Dr. Henry Patrick McCoy based on Professor Charles Francis Xavier&#39;s original Cerebro, the mini-cerebra&#39;s resemble small everyday objects such as wrist watches and PDAs and iPods. The device can be used to find and detect a mutant or other lifeforms within a local area of several miles. Additionally, they are linked to the Cerebra mainframe.<br >
						Note: Mod approval is required.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">MNEMONIC CLOCK:</span> The device will cloak <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span>&#39;s memories from telepathic or other psychic intrusions. Additionally, the Mnemoic Cloak is equiped with a preload &#39;memory set&#39; for the telepath to read, thus providing false information as being authentic. Only the most skilled telepaths can detect such devices, and only if specifically looking for them.<br >
						Note: Mod approval is required.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">MULTI-TOOL:</span> Anybody can get a pretty good commercially available multi-tool at any sporting goods store these days. <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> has one that can do the jobs all those can do, plus a little more. <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X </span>has a little blowtorch in it and some of the tools are powered electrically, for which there is a battery in the tool itself as well as a plug so he can spare the battery by running it from an outlet.<span style="color:#9ba9c5;"> </span></p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">REBREATHER:</span> For supplying oxygen, most typically when underwater, <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> has a miniaturized rebreather with two-inch canisters on either side of the mouthpiece. They provide up to two hours worth of breathable air, and the whole device can break down and fit into a single utility belt pouch.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">PSIONIC DAMPER:</span> The device will dampen any and all psionic abilities possessed abilities. The damper requires that it be unlocked to be removed from it&#39;s host.<br >
						Note: Mod approval is required.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">PSIONIC SHIELD:</span> The device provides shielding against telepathic intrusion and/or other psionic based attacks.<br >
						Note: Mod approval is required.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">SHACKLES - Neutralizing:</span> A corruption of Dr. Moira MacTaggart, these shackles when worn emit a unique neural frequency which inhibits a mutants natural abilities. Note that some powers, like hyper-strength, a prehensiled tail or winged flight can not be neutralized.<br >
						Note: Mod approval is required.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">SMARTPHONE - Type:</span> <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> utilizes a <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">TYPE OF SMARTPHONE HERE. (i.e. BlackBerry, iPhone, Pearl, Trio, etc. all.)</span> which is a kind of mobile phone offering advanced capabilities beyond those typical of a mobile phone, often with PC-like functionality.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">SMARTPHONE - iPhone:</span> A type of &#39;smart phone&#39; made by Apple, the &#39;iPhone&#39; is a kind of mobile phone which offers advanced capabilities beyond those typical of a mobile phone, often with PC-like functionality to <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> in the field. It has the latest and greatest in modern computer hardware packed into its collapsible frame, and is able to create and work with a wide variety of media-storage. It has a global positioning system and encrypted wireless uplink to the Internet. The software is primarily focused on aiding investigation and research tasks.</p>

The software is primarily focused on aiding investigation and research tasks.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">SONIC SCREWDRIVER:</span> The devices most common functionality is to virtually operate any locking mechanism, electronic or otherwise, and thus open doors/locked objects. In some instances it can be used used for the repairing of equipment, or as an offensive weapon if the threat is mechanical in nature. It can also be used to drive a few screws; burning, cutting, fusing or igniting of metallic substances; driving screws (it is called a sonic screwdriver for a reason); and amplifying sound, usually to stun or incapacitate a mechanical enemy. The Sonic Screwdriver can not affect a lock which has a &#39;Deadlock Seal&#39; applied to it.<br >
						Note: Mod approval is required.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">SUBSONIC BAT-CALL:</span> This electronic device gives a subsonic signal that attracts all bats within a 10-mile radius to Batman. <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> primarily uses this to create a distraction for escape from or dramatic entry upon a scene. It grants no control of the animals after they arrive, but most will begin to depart the scene after confusedly swirling around the source of the sound.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">TRACER DEVICES:</span> <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> has access to two main tracer devices that he uses to keep track of people and items during his adventures. The first is a short-range burr tracer, which is extremely small and has a relatively short transmission range of 1,500 feet. It can transmit for up to a month, and its directional signal is extremely difficult to detect by anyone who isn&#39;t looking for it. The second is a throwing tracer, which is slightly smaller than the burr model and which has a greater range and more transmitting power - up to three miles.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">UNIVERSAL TOOL:</span> <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> often utilizes this compact multi-purpose electronics tool. Contained within the removable tip and base are a multitude of tool tips and electrical components for use in disabling, repairing, or otherwise dealing with mechanical and electronic gear. It has its own fuel cell, but can also use AC and DC power jacks. The entire device can fit into a single utility belt pouch.</p>
					 
					 <p>
						<span style="color:#5bb3ff;">UTILITY BELT:</span> <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> keeps a wide range of gadgets and equipment on his person when in costume, the vast majority of which is contained in his famed utility belt. The eight pouches can contain a variety of items of differing sizes, the nature of which are chosen before he heads out in costume for the night&#39;s patrol or other adventure. <span style="color:#9ba9c5;">X</span> has one pouch which contains some items he regularly expects to find useful; keys, lockpicks, cash, first aid kit, antivenin for a variety of poisons, signal flares, a cell phone, miniature flashlight, and wireless listening devices. The belt also has a built in self-destruct feature used to prevent theft or tampering.</p>

						<p>
							Measurement is the estimation of the magnitude of some attribute of an object, such as its length or weight, relative to a unit of measurement. We use the term AP to represent our units of measurement much like you might use a ruler to meausre the length of something or scale to weight something. The specific purpose of APs is to help players judge what their characters can and can&#39;t do.*</p>

 						<p>
							Distance is a numerical description of how far apart objects are at any given moment in time. In physics or everyday discussion, distance may refer to a physical length, a period of time, or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. &quot;two counties over&quot;). We use the term APs to represent our units of distance and measurement much like you might use a ruler to meausre a length of string or scale to find the weight of an object. The specific purpose of APs is to help players judge what their characters can and can&#39;t do.*<br />
							<br />
							We are still working on this tables measurements (but you can use it for now with the understanding that we will revise it soon.)</p>

						<p>What are Natures and Demeanors? Well, they are sort of like Jungian Archetypes. Each describes an essential form of your character's personality. A character's Nature shows the underlying element making up a persona (i.e., the "true" self), while the Demeanor is the "face" that the character shows to others around them. What follows is a list of Natures and Demeanors we are allowing, along with a (very) brief description of each.</p>

You are the type of person who makes an effort to build something of value: to found a town, create a company or in some way leave a lasting legacy.

Lackies have a need, subconscious or not, to find someone or something to lead the way for them. As such, they are easily manipulated by those that they follow and are often seen as weak and without a backbone.

You are the type of person who is always alone, even in the midst of a crowd. You are the wanderer, hunter and lone wolf. Though others might think of you as lonely, forsaken, isolated or remote, in truth you prefer your own company to that of others. There are many different reasons why this might be so: you don't understand people, you understand people too well, people dislike you, people like you too much, or you are simply lost in your own thoughts. Your reasons are your own.

						<p><span style="color:#9ba9c5;"><strong>MANIPULATOR</strong></span> - You have always been fascinated by others. Why do people behave as they do? What thoughts and emotions affect their actions? The cognitive processes that influence the choices people make intrigue you. Sometimes just asking people questions about their actions can yield important information, but often people do not truly understand their own motivations and concerns. In these cases, it is far easier to set up situations, experiments, if you will, to see how people behave. You attempt to manipulate these situations for your personal advantage, in order to discover more information about your chosen subjects. Some might call these experiments cruel, but to you it is mere scientific necessity.

Even fewer live the life of a Martyr, but you are such a one. Your desire for self-sacrifice stems either from a low self-esteem, a feeling of a lack of control, or a profoundly developed sense of love. You are able to endure long-lasting and severe suffering because of your beliefs and ideals. At worst, a Martyr expects sympathy and attention because of his or her suffering, and may even feign or exaggerate pain or deprivation. At best, a Martyr will choose to suffer injury or even the Final Death rather than renounce his religion, beliefs, principles, cause or friends.

You gain a certain satisfaction from suffering humiliation, depravation and even mutilation, especially when you are the cause of your pain and have some control over it. You know that your need is somewhat perverse, but you know you aren't crazy. This is just the way you are.

These people often have immense trouble finding and communicating with each other. That is where you come in. You are dedicated to mediating between people, fulfilling needs, smoothing over disputes, and generally helping people talk to one another. You are the diplomat, the middle child, the perpetual person in the middle.

Evil and suffering are the Monster's tools, and she uses them wherever she goes. No villany is below her; no hurt goes uninflicted and no lie remains untold. The Monster does not commit evil for its own sake, but rather as a means to understand what she has become. Many behind the scenes players, degenerates and unstable individuals display characteristics of the Monster Archetype. Monster characters should pick a specific atrocity that they enjoy indulging; for example, a tempter regains Willpower for luring someone into wickness, while an apostate regains Willpower for causing another to doubt her faith. Pick a destiny and fulfill it.

Teaching is your avocation, if not necessarily your profession. In your time you've seen inexperience and ignorance lead to all kinds of misery and misfortune, and it pains you too much to stand by and watch this occur. You are dedicated to passing on what you have learned for the benefit of others, not only skills and knowledge, but also the less tangible assets of wisdom and experience. If given the chance you can lecture others for hours.

You are base, vile and lacking in virtue. You have no right to exist and are utterly beyond redemption. Either because of a low self-image or because of a spectacular trauma in your past, you feel compelled to spend your life making up for what you are, what you lack or what you have done. You owe it to Creation at large to offer repentance for the crime of your existence. You struggle nightly to make amends for your weakness, and your nightly dream is to be able, at last, to overcome it. But you know you are weak and beyond hope.

Neither can you tolerate those who do not do everything they can to do their best, to make everything neat and proper and right in their lives. Though you may be strict with others, it is with yourself that you are most critical, everything must always be in its place, and you must always do the best and be the best.

You try to plan everything in your life; each thing you do must accomplish something in the greater scheme. Deviation from routine, however, is bothersome, not traumatic. You are organized, not deranged. You tend to be neat and precise in everything you do.

The sensible way to deal with trouble is to deny it a target. While some people might accuse you of sticking your head in the sand, they do have to admit that it has remained on your shoulders for quite some time, and looks like it will continue to do so indefinitely. You never confront what you can evade, and never face anything unless there is no other option. Courage is not high on your list of virtues, but then the line between courage and folly is virtually nonexistent to your eyes.

You are just yourself and only desire the freedom to be yourself. You do not make a good follower and aren't usually a very good leader either (unless your followers are willing to go wherever you lead). You tend to be insubordinate to authority to the point of stupidity. Rebels may oppose the government, Church, a teacher, a prince, their mother, whatever.

The system a Scientist attempts to impose on the world may be completely ludicrous, but it is a system, and she sticks by it.

							RE (RESOURCES) - Resources represent a characters available cash. But, it isn&#39;t just about the money though. It is the ability to get money or valuable equipment through many, many channels It is the measure of personal wealth and influence and or lack their of which a character possesses. For example, Captain America is not a rich man, and never will be. Still, he is able to call on the vae resources of the Ultimates, S.H.I.E.L.D. and more then half the United States of America&#39;s Goverment because he is a living American legend. So, a Resource rank, in addition to being a volumn of money can also be something which your character has readily has access to, but does not regularily carry on their person.</p>

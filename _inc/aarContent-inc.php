	"overview" => "<p>An 'advantage' is a condition or circumstance that grants XXXcNameXXX some amount of favorable, position, or other unique edge within the context of the story. To put it another way, an advantage is something which helps the character (such as a good position or condition) that helps to make someone or something better or more likely to succeed than others. Advantages come in several catagories from an acute awareness like second sight, to strength of belief in a particular higher power which possibly grants the character an immunity to dark or baser influences, to a physical trait such as being ambidexterious. An advantage should be thought of something which provides a character a great benefit, but is not actually a super power.</p>
<p>
	Similarly, characters who derive their abilities from artificial or external sources such as <em>Iron Man's</em> robotic exoskelton, the <em>Winter Soldier</em> and his bionic limb or <em>Dr. Spectrum's</em> Soul Gem may be fairly described as having superpowers, but are not necessarily superhuman.</p>
<p>
	Using the power categories  you will be taken to many possible descriptions of various advantages available to XXXcNameXXX catagorized in to easily digestable bits.

	<h5><span class='label label-danger'>Playbys</span> <span class='label label-primary'>Character Creation</span></h5><br>
	<p>
		So you've just joined Marvel Champion's online Roleplaying site, and you want people to pay attention to you and the character you'll be handling. What do you do? The best way to keep other roleplayers from ignoring you is to choose a play-by for your character..
	</p>
	<h2>What is a Playby?</h2>
	<p>
		Play-bys are models, celebrities, hipsters, and scene kids that roleplayers use to Visually represent the characters in play. selects a play-by for her character, she will mine the internets for photographs of that particular person and molest them with grunge brushes, song lyrics, and whatever pretentious character name the roleplayer dug out of babynames.com. Said roleplayer will post the play-by on her character's profile, and all of the other site's members will ooh and aah over how sexy and cool the character looks. Many internet scholars theorize that the attractiveness of a roleplayer is inversely proportional to the attractiveness of her average character, which means that sites that require or encourage play-bys are overloaded with some of the ugliest women on the planet.
	</p>
	<h2>How to claim a Playby</h2>
	<p>
		Once a handler(Player) has settled on a playby for their character, they enter it into the character creation form. If the playby is available, the form will accept the handler's request and automatically update our claims page for you. If you request a playby which is already in use, you will get a polite notice stating that that playby has already been claimed.</p>
	<p>
		<em>NOTE: While most characters on Marvel Champions have assigned faceclaims, many of them are muteable. If a character does not have an active handler, they may not have an active claim on a specific faceclaim and as always, the handler who get's their character approved first has first claim on a playby.</em></p>
	<h2>So What's Considered Fairgame?</h2>
	<p>
		If a person is considered to be active in the public space, meaning they have some kind of public persona such as that of a famous athelete or actor or even a podcaster, their considered fairgame.
	</p>

	<h3>Some DO's &amp DON'Ts of Character Casting</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Not every character has to come from the cast of whatever show is currently hot on MTV or the CW; While Dylan O'Brian has a nice range, he wouldn't be any more right to play Professor X then would Margaret Thatcher.
		</li>

		<li>Select a model who is appropriate to the age, ethnicity, and general appearance of the character you are casting.</li>

		<li>All images uses should be appropriate to the database, that means no images with pubic hair, nipples, etc. The character database is not meant to act like a cheap version of MATCH.COM. If you submit images for you character like fit into that catagory, Staff will handle your image assignments, case closed. If your not sure if an image is appropriate, then likely it's not and don't use it. Again, case closed.</li>

		<li>Sometimes Hollywood just plain gets it wrong when casting a character. Example, January Jones as the White Queen. Yes she had Blonde hair, but her portrayal was more '60s Playboy Cocktail Bunny than it was the White Queen. Image white have been if Charlize Theron or Jessica Chastaine or even Madonna had been cast in the part of the White Queen.</li>

Once I throw the final switch, New York will be under my complete, autonomous control."<br /><br />Dr. Oct was about to laugh, but the lights above them suddenly flickered, then went out. The blackout was likely due to the amount of power which his cold fusion reactor was drawing from the city. The old subterrain wiring likely couldn\'t handle the stress of the load it had been tasked with carring and now the lights were out if only for the moment. In the darkness, Dr. Oct was likely startled - if that was the case, then perhaps his tentacle had eased it\'s grip on Aunt May\'s neck...

You are responsible for crafting XXXcgPossessiveXXX every character detail, from XXXcgPossessiveXXX name, to XXXcgPossessiveXXX skills and abilities, to XXXcgPossessiveXXX character history. We encourage you to think about XXXcgObjectiveXXX in all of XXXcgPossessiveXXX potential character dimensions; How did XXXcgSubjectiveXXX get XXXcgPossessiveXXX powers? Does XXXcgPossessiveXXX keep it a secret? Has XXXcgPossessiveXXX shared XXXcgPossessiveXXX secret with anyone? Does XXXcgPossessiveXXX want to be a hero? Does XXXcgPossessiveXXX have any life goals beyond heroing? What about XXXcgPossessiveXXX family? We know this seems like a lot to do, and we recognize that it is a lot of potential work. Hence we\'ve developed a lot of systems to help you along the way from drop-down selects, character asset libraries for you to draw on, to autoloading descriptions, etc. Heck, if you select a playby from our image library, you\'ll find that our system will autoload those images from our library into your profile when in view mode. However the edit mode will not show this so that it is clear that no images have actually yet been assigned. We believe that it is actually possible to complete a first draft of a character profile in less then an hour - good luck and we hope you have fun working on the XXXcNameXXX\'s profile!',

Think about your hero in all dimensions from how they got their powers to who they first shared their secrets to how they hide their dual life from the public. It's quite easy with our drop down menu and insert functions.</p>

		<ol>
			<li><b>CHOOSING A MAIN BACKGROUND/BANNER IMAGE (940x460px):</b> Ideally this will capture the hero in action or show a particular aspect of them in costume. You can use photos of a real-life actor or model, or other well know celebrity to represent XcNameX, or a reasonably realistic artist rendering to convey the the look and feel of XcNameX. The banner image can be in or out of uniform, the goal is to select something which truly represents XcGenderX. Such images should be relatively clothed, even the Hulk has pants. The image should not look like an attempt at a Tinder hook-up.<br /><i>Image size is 940x460 pixels.</i></li>

			<li><b>CHOOSING A CHARACTER PROFILE IMAGE (170x170px):</b> Profile image is what is used throughout the site to represent your character, both on the character\'s profile page and when posting or otherwised referenced - it is essentially your character avatar. As such the image selected should be an iconic representation of your character. And as with the main banner image, the profile image should not look like an attempt at a Tinder hook-up. Even Namor eventually abandoned his speedo for something with a little dignifired too it.<br /><i>Image size is 170x170 pixels.</i></li>

			<li><b>CHOOSING A CHARACTER GALLERY IMAGE(S) (500x500px):</b>  Yup, while it might not be apparent at first glance, every character automatically has a character gallery of images which is available by clicking on the main character profile image on their particular profile page.) You can upload as many images as you would like, of which four will be randomly selected at any given time along with your main prolfile image.  When someone selects a gallery image thumbail, your full character gallery will be exposed for view. The images are meant to represent your character both in their every day life as well as when they're being adventuresome. As with site policy regarding image selection, the profile images should not look like an attempt at a Tinder hook-up. You can have a shirtless image or two, but they should not constitute the magority of your image selections for a character. Even Emma Frost ultimately gave up the corset afterall.<br /><i>Image size is 500x500 pixels.</i>

		So you've just joined Marvel Champion's online Roleplaying site, and you want people to pay attention to you and the character you'll be handling. What do you do? The best way to keep other roleplayers from ignoring you is to choose a play-by for your character..
	</p>

	<h2>What is a Playby?</h2>
	<p>
		Play-bys are models, celebrities, hipsters, and scene kids that roleplayers use to Visually represent the characters in play. selects a play-by for her character, she will mine the internets for photographs of that particular person and molest them with grunge brushes, song lyrics, and whatever pretentious character name the roleplayer dug out of babynames.com. Said roleplayer will post the play-by on her character's profile, and all of the other site's members will ooh and aah over how sexy and cool the character looks. Many internet scholars theorize that the attractiveness of a roleplayer is inversely proportional to the attractiveness of her average character, which means that sites that require or encourage play-bys are overloaded with some of the ugliest women on the planet.
	</p>

	<h2>How to claim a Playby</h2>
	<p>
		Once a handler(Player) has settled on a playby for their character, they enter it into the character creation form. If the playby is available, the form will accept the handler's request and automatically update our claims page for you. If you request a playby which is already in use, you will get a polite notice stating that that playby has already been claimed.</p>
	<p>
		<em>NOTE: While most characters on Marvel Champions have assigned faceclaims, many of them are muteable. If a character does not have an active handler, they may not have an active claim on a specific faceclaim and as always, the handler who get's their character approved first has first claim on a playby.</em></p>

	<h2>So What's Considered Fairgame?</h2>
	<p>
		If a person is considered to be active in the public space, meaning they have some kind of public persona such as that of a famous athelete or actor or even a podcaster, their considered fairgame.

		There is no rigid definition of a &quot;superpower&quot;. In popular culture, it may be used to describe anything from minimal exaggeration of normal human traits, magic, to godlike abilities that far exceed the scope of expectation or even possibility. Such super powered traits can be as simple as flight to the ability to projected unimagined destructive force with a simple look.</p>
	<p>
		Generally speaking, exceptional-but-not-superhuman fictional characters like the Avengers' <em>Black Widow</em> and <em>Hawkeye</em> or <em>Ka-zar</em> of the Savage Lands may be classified as superheroes although they do not have any &quot;actual&quot; superpowers. Common sense and an abilityt to think situations through should never be underestimated.</p>
	<p>
		Similarly, characters who derive their abilities from artificial or external sources such as <em>Iron Man's</em> robotic exoskelton, the <em>Winter Soldier</em> and his bionic limb or <em>Dr. Spectrum's</em> Soul Gem may be fairly described as having superpowers, but are not necessarily superhuman.</p>

	Energy-emission powers are exactly what you are likely imaginging when you hear the term. They are bolts of lightning, bursts of extreme cold, or even the abscence such as that of shadow caster Darkstar of the Winter Guard. Energy emission powers can be emitted by any part of the hero's body. For most Powers, it is not important to specify the emergence point. For the Powers of the Energy Emission class, though, emission points become important. This affects how the hero utilizes his Power. It determines ways goes can negate that Power. If the hero loses the part of their body containing the emission point, they may lose their Power as well. When creating the hero, the player should determine an, emission point for any Energy Emission Powers. They may select the first one rolled as the point for all of their character's Energy Emissions, or be adventurous and determine one for each Power.

Flight for instance can be accomplished in a variety of ways, from wingless unassisted flight to possessing weird and wild inhuman-like membranes which run along from under your arms down the complete length of your legs - anything is possible! Also consider what happens if something should go amiss, such as if they have rocket jets in their boots like Iron Man, and the Trapster should fire some flame retardent paste and snag the bottom of your characters boots, what do you do. What. Do. You. Do?

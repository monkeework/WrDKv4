"RANDOM </span></em>The most common form of mutation, is a person who is a member of a gentec offshoot humanity, often described as a subspecies called Homo sapien superior (sometimes inaccurately referred to as a separate species). All mutants have a genetic mutation called an X-gene that causes their bodies to develop abilities that regular humans cannot. The majority of mutants develop these abilities, which vary from person to person, upon puberty, though there are some mutants who display powers and/or physical mutations from birth. Some mutants even display abilities from within the womb and posthumously, like Professor Charles Xavier and Jean Grey, respectively.<br >
	I.E. <em>Wolverine, Toad, Forge</em></p>
<p>HEREDITARY </span></em>A mutation endowed upon a person by their birth, in that one or both of their parents, or in some cases grandparents were mutants, and the x-gene has been passed through generations and has been activated within a certain person. IN some cases, the abilities of these mutants may be similar to those held by the parents in question.<br >
	I.E. <em>Asgardian, Legion, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch &amp; Speed</em></p>
<p>LATENT </span></em>One who possesses a mutant gene which while it will never become active in them, they can pass on there offspring. I.E. <em>Sarah Grey, Moira MacTaggart</em></p>

<p>Mutants of this classification have an unusual physiognomy; which refers to added limbs or missing limbs, but not to the extent of aberrancy, any aspect of an appearance that is different than one would expect of a human-being. These can be directly related to the mutation, such as claws or unusual teeth/ears. Usually these specifics don&#39;t entail much disadvantage upon the holder, and can be useful in some instances.</p>

<p>These mutants uphold a Bodily appearance that can make a mutant look vaguely or completely reminiscent of an animal or different species. For example, sasquatch/beast. This will usually entail some sort of furry/scaly exterior and can sometimes mean that skin pigment is altered and mutants can have unusual skin colours/tones.

<p>The mutant in question knows nothing about X ability, nor its capabilities. The power(s) may cause many disadvantages, and in some cases, may cause feinting or comaisation when they are used. The mutant has no control regarding when the powers are in use or not.</p>

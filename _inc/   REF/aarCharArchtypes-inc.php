	"Addict" => "<p>You need someone to nurture and take care of you (For the love of god please don't pick this). You are still immature in personality and temperament: a kid who never grew up. Though you can (hopefully) care for yourself, you prefer the security of being watched over by others. Often you seek out someone to look out for you, a caretaker of sorts. Some see you as a spoiled brat, while others see you as an innocent cherub unaffected by the evils of the world. This is a very common archetype for Kindred who were created when they were young and subsequently matured mentally, but not emotionally. Some Child Archetypes are actually innocent rather than immature, ignorant of the cold ways of the real world. Children, spoiled individuals and some drug abusers are Child Archetypes.

The thrill of victory is the only thrill you recognize; it is the thing that drives you. You see life as a contest and society as a dichotomy of winners and losers. You believe all the macho business proverbs, &quot;if you're not lead dog, the view never changes&quot;; &quot;there are no prizes for second place&quot; &quot;eat or be eaten.&quot; You try to turn every situation into a contest of some kind, and it is the only way you can relate to anything. You are capable of cooperating with others, but only by turning the group interactions into another contest: you must be the leader, or the most productive, or the most indispensable, or the best liked, anything, as long as it means you win in some way or another.

It is easy for you to adapt, attune, adjust, comply and reconcile yourself to whatever new situation you find yourself in. You flit to the brightest star, the person whom you feel to be the best, throwing your lot in with her. It is both difficult and distasteful for you to go against the flow or rebel. You hate inconsistency and instability, and know that by supporting a strong leader, you help prevent chaos from occurring. All stable groups need some kind of Conformist.

Why drudge when, just by talking, you can get what you want? You always try to find the easy way out, the fast track to success and wealth. Some people might call what you do swindling or even outright theft, but you know that you only do what everyone else does; you just do it better. Additionally, it's a game, and you get great pleasure out of outwitting someone.

	"CRITIC" => "<p>Nothing is perfect, everything sucks, and you want to make sure everyone knows it. Nothing in the world should be accepted without thorough scrutiny and examination. Nothing is ever perfect, and the blemishes must be pointed out in order for the good to be truly known. Your standards are high for everything, and you insist on their being met. You encourage the same ideals in others, because laxity and low standards reduce the quality of life for everyone. Others will thank you later, once they discover the purity of your perspective. You seek out and expose the imperfections in every person or thing you encounter. You are never satisfied with anything that is less than perfect, unless it is within yourself after all, you're not a perfectionist.

	"CURMUDGEON" => "<p>Nothing is perfect, everything sucks, and you want to make sure everyone knows it. You are an irascible, churlish person at heart, taking everything seriously and finding little humor in life (though you may have a wickedly barbed wit). Cynicism is your middle name; it is the tool with which you judge everything in life. You have a very well-defined understanding of how things really work, especially when they involve the circus of human endeavor. Long ago the foolish actions of others ceased to surprise you. Regain a Willpower point whenever someone does something stupid, just like you said they would.

Most Dabblers have high Intelligence, Charisma and Manipulation ratings, but not much in the way of Wits or Stamina.

Your beliefs, motivations and sense of propriety are the complete antithesis of the status quo. You are not so much an aimless rebel as an independent thinker who does not belong in the society in which you were raised. You don't give a damn about other people's morality, but you do adhere to your own strange code of conduct. Deviants are typically irreverent, and some have truly bizarre tastes and desires.

Every ounce of blood and passion you possess is directed toward it; in fact, you may feel very guilty about spending time on anything else. You will let nothing stand in your way, nothing that you cannot overcome, in any case. You and those around you may suffer, but your cause is everything, the end justifies the means.

A consummate actor who loves to make as big a show of things as possible, nothing attracts your attention more than an appreciative audience. You love people and you love to impress them even more. Though you may indeed be a superior lover, you enjoy the chase almost as much as you enjoy the act.

	"IDEALIST" => "<p>You are dedicated to the unbroken routine of your existence, and refuse to do anything that compromises your routine and established practices. No matter how urgent or deserving an individual case may be, the preservation of established practices and routines is more important. Individual decisions and considerations are fallible, whereas routines and established procedures are the distilled wisdom of years or decades of decision-making. Routines are what separate order from chaos. Make an exception once, and it sets a dangerous precedent; make an exception twice, and the door to anarchy is opened.

	"<p>JUDGE" => "<p>You know what is right and what wrong, and you will make sure others know, too. As a facilitator, moderator, arbitrator, conciliator and peacemaker, you always seek to make things better. You pride yourself on your rationality, your judgment and your ability to deduce a reasonable explanation when given the facts. You struggle to promote truth, but you understand how difficult it is to ascertain. You respect justice, for that is the way in which truth can reign. In your view, people are resources, albeit ones that are most difficult to manage and employ. You hate dissension and arguments, and shy away from dogmatism. Sometimes Judges make good leaders, though a lack of vision can sometimes cause them to maintain the status quo instead of searching for a better way.

Though others might think of you as lonely, forsaken, isolated or remote, in truth you prefer your own company to that of others. There are many different reasons why this might be so: you don't understand people, you understand people too well, people dislike you, people like you too much, or you are simply lost in your own thoughts. Your reasons are your own.

	"MANIPULATOR" => "<p>You have always been fascinated by others. Why do people behave as they do? What thoughts and emotions affect their actions? The cognitive processes that influence the choices people make intrigue you. Sometimes just asking people questions about their actions can yield important information, but often people do not truly understand their own motivations and concerns. In these cases, it is far easier to set up situations, experiments, if you will, to see how people behave. You attempt to manipulate these situations for your personal advantage, in order to discover more information about your chosen subjects. Some might call these experiments cruel, but to you it is mere scientific necessity.

	"MARTYR" => "<p>Everyone else benefits when you take on the burdens of the world.... All possess the martyr instinct, but few act upon it. Even fewer live the life of a Martyr, but you are such a one. Your desire for self-sacrifice stems either from a low self-esteem, a feeling of a lack of control, or a profoundly developed sense of love. You are able to endure long-lasting and severe suffering because of your beliefs and ideals. At worst, a Martyr expects sympathy and attention because of his or her suffering, and may even feign or exaggerate pain or deprivation. At best, a Martyr will choose to suffer injury or even the Final Death rather than renounce his religion, beliefs, principles, cause or friends.

You like to push the boundaries and try to see how much you can take, how much pain you can tolerate before you collapse. You gain a certain satisfaction from suffering humiliation, depravation and even mutilation, especially when you are the cause of your pain and have some control over it. You know that your need is somewhat perverse, but you know you aren't crazy. This is just the way you are.

	"MEDIATOR" => "<p>The world is full of people who want things; sometimes people want the exact same thing. Some people have what other people want and would be willing to talk about working out a deal, but just don't know how to start. These people often have immense trouble finding and communicating with each other. That is where you come in. You are dedicated to mediating between people, fulfilling needs, smoothing over disputes, and generally helping people talk to one another. You are the diplomat, the middle child, the perpetual person in the middle.

	"MISGUIDED-VILLAIN" => "<p>Youíre a bad guy. Or at least, you think you are. Maybe you strike out at people because your older brother stole your toys as a kid. Or maybe you were simply raised by the wrong people. Maybe your addiction or power pushes you to the less-heroic side of things. Maybe you were once a hero or good guy who got disillusioned with society and crossed over. Whatever the reason, Misguided-Villains generally have a good heart, even if they do the wrong things. With time and effort, it might be possible to bring them back to the ëgoodí side ñ but it wonít be easy.

	"MONSTER" => "<p>Your purpose comes from a malignant drive to show off evil....The Monster knows she is a creature of darkness and acts like it. Evil and suffering are the Monster's tools, and she uses them wherever she goes. No villany is below her; no hurt goes uninflicted and no lie remains untold. The Monster does not commit evil for its own sake, but rather as a means to understand what she has become. Many behind the scenes players, degenerates and unstable individuals display characteristics of the Monster Archetype. Monster characters should pick a specific atrocity that they enjoy indulging; for example, a tempter regains Willpower for luring someone into wickness, while an apostate regains Willpower for causing another to doubt her faith. Pick a destiny and fulfill it.

Some call you a fool, but even they have to admit you're happier than they are.

You've been a few places, seen a few things, and picked up a thing or two along the way, and you like to tell everyone about what you've learned. Teaching is your avocation, if not necessarily your profession. In your time you've seen inexperience and ignorance lead to all kinds of misery and misfortune, and it pains you too much to stand by and watch this occur. You are dedicated to passing on what you have learned for the benefit of others, not only skills and knowledge, but also the less tangible assets of wisdom and experience. If given the chance you can lecture others for hours.

	"PENITENT" => "<p>You are a sinner, and you cannot rest until you have atoned for your sins. You are unworthy. You are sinful. You are base, vile and lacking in virtue. You have no right to exist and are utterly beyond redemption. Either because of a low self-image or because of a spectacular trauma in your past, you feel compelled to spend your life making up for what you are, what you lack or what you have done. You owe it to Creation at large to offer repentance for the crime of your existence. You struggle nightly to make amends for your weakness, and your nightly dream is to be able, at last, to overcome it. But you know you are weak and beyond hope.

Neither can you tolerate those who do not do everything they can to do their best, to make everything neat and proper and right in their lives.

	"PLOTTER" => "<p>Everything you do is planned. Very little springs from you spontaneously. Your plans are often long and involved, sometimes extending beyond the lives of the mortals involved in them. Details must be exact, for you believe any deviation could bring ruin. You try to plan everything in your life; each thing you do must accomplish something in the greater scheme. Deviation from routine, however, is bothersome, not traumatic. You are organized, not deranged. You tend to be neat and precise in everything you do.

	"POLTROON" => "<p>Meeting trouble (or anything else ) head-on is the tactic of fools and optimists. The sensible way to deal with trouble is to deny it a target. While some people might accuse you of sticking your head in the sand, they do have to admit that it has remained on your shoulders for quite some time, and looks like it will continue to do so indefinitely. You never confront what you can evade, and never face anything unless there is no other option. Courage is not high on your list of virtues, but then the line between courage and folly is virtually nonexistent to your eyes.

You do not make a good follower and aren't usually a very good leader either (unless your followers are willing to go wherever you lead). You tend to be insubordinate to authority to the point of stupidity. Rebels may oppose the government, Church, a teacher, a prince, their mother, whatever. The player should choose whom or what his characters rebels against when he adopts this Archetype.

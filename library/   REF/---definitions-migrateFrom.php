							RE (RESOURCES) - Resources represent a characters available cash. But, it isn&#39;t just about the money though. It is the ability to get money or valuable equipment through many, many channels It is the measure of personal wealth and influence and or lack their of which a character possesses. For example, Captain America is not a rich man, and never will be. Still, he is able to call on the vae resources of the Ultimates, S.H.I.E.L.D. and more then half the United States of America&#39;s Goverment because he is a living American legend. So, a Resource rank, in addition to being a volumn of money can also be something which your character has readily has access to, but does not regularily carry on their person.</p>

						<p>
							Below is a table which illustrates a characters RE (Resources) score with examples to help better gage what each rank represents.<br />
							Following the RE chart, you will find various descriptions XPG sanctioned Resources for your character application. Please select those, if any which are approperiate for your character and copy them from this directory and paste them in to your characters &#39;Disadvantages&#39; section. When pasting the descriptions, please take a moment to proof read the pronoun descriptions and make sure that they properly reflect your characters gender.</p>
